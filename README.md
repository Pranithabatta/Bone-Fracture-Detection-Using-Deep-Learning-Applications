<h3>Introduction</h3>
<pr>Bone fractures are a common medical condition that requires timely and accurate diagnosis. This project leverages deep learning techniques to automatically detect fractures from X-ray images. By doing so, it aims to assist healthcare professionals in making faster and more reliable diagnoses.
This project is part of my academic coursework, undertaken to gain hands-on experience with machine learning and its applications in medical imaging.</pr>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
<pr>The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes a large number of labeled X-ray images, with annotations indicating the presence or absence of fractures.</pr>
<ul>
  <li>Dataset Source: Kaggle Bone Fracture Detection Dataset</li>
  <li>Number of Images: 4911</li>
  <li>Annotations: Fracture (Yes/No), Fracture Type </li>
</ul>
